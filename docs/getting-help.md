# Getting help

I am most responsive on Discord, feel free to ping me in [Python Discord](https://discord.com/invite/python), the [#editors-ide](https://discord.com/channels/267624335836053506/813178633006350366) channel is a suitable place for that.

If you don't use Discord then feel free to open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyterlab_code_formatter/issues), do note I am a bit slower in responding in GitHub.
